 #  description 
 #  
 #    A Ruby layer wrapping around C calls to the NI-Scope drivers.
 #    Most C data manipulation and C calls are done through the FFI gems.
 #	  In addition a few C methods are provided for improved efficiency when handling data
 #
 #  installation
 #
 #    gem install ni_scope-x.y.z.gem
 #
 #  usage
 #
 #    refer to rb_scope/test/test_rb_scope.rb
 #
 #  binaries
 #    
 #    the gem comes with precompiled 32bits libraries which should run on
 #    Windows 32/64 bits without issues if your niScope drivers are
 #    installed correctly
 #
 #    If necessary, the source files and script files to produce the binaries
 #    are included with this gem, in rb_scope/ext/
 #
 #    Two binary dlls are required 
 #    Because of a recent change in the NiScope drivers, it is now necesaary to use
 #    MSVS cl and link to compiles them (it should be theoretically possible with mingw
 #    but I have better things to do). To be able to compile the project on your PC
 #    you should install Visual Studio C++ Express and use the VS developper prompt
 #    which automatically configures your %PATH% variable and allows you to use MSVS
 #    compiler and linker.
 #
 #    If everything is fine you can just compile fetch.dll and rb_scope.dll with rake
 #    Run at the gem root directory the commands
 #      rake dll_fetch
 #      rake dll_rb_scope
 #    
 #    My scripts assume that you have a normal NiScope driver installation when looking 
 #    for header files from NI. In the event these hardcoded paths are not correct, you
 #    should edit rakefile.rb and provides paths to headers and to static libraries .lib
 #
 #    Expected path of the necessary header files and library:
 #
 #     niScope.h, ivi.h, iviScope.h
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Include
 #
 #     visa.h, visatype.h, vpptype.h
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\include
 #
 #     niScope.lib
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Lib\msc
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Lib_x64\msc
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\Lib\msc
 #       C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\Lib_x64\msc
