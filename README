    Description

      A Ruby layer wrapping C calls to the NI-Scope drivers.
      Most C data manipulation and C calls are done through the FFI gems.
  	  In addition a few C methods are provided for improved efficiency
      when handling data

    Installation

      run at the gem root directory
        $ gem install ni_scope-x.y.z.gem

      or use the rake command:
        $ rake gem_install

    Usage

      refer to example code rb_scope/test/test_rb_scope.rb

    Binaries

      the gem comes with precompiled 32bits libraries which should run on
      Windows 32/64 bits without issues if your niScope drivers are
      installed correctly.

      If necessary, the source files and script files to produce the binaries
      are included with this gem, in rb_scope/ext/

      Two binary dlls are required.

      Because of a recent change in the NiScope drivers, it is now necessary
      to use MSVS cl and link program to compiles these two binaries (it should
      be theoretically possible with mingw).

      To be able to compile them on your PC you should install Visual Studio
      C++ Express and use the VS developper prompt which automatically
      configures your %PATH% variable and allows you to use MSVS compiler
      and linker.

      If everything is fine you can just compile fetch.dll and rb_scope.dll
      using rake: run at the gem root directory the commands
        $ rake dll_fetch
        $ rake dll_rb_scope

      The install scripts assume that you have a normal NiScope driver
      installation on yoru system when looking for header files from NI.
      In the event these hardcoded paths are not correct, you should edit
      rakefile.rb and provides paths to headers and to static libraries .lib

      Expected path of the necessary header files and library:

       niScope.h, ivi.h, iviScope.h
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Include

       visa.h, visatype.h, vpptype.h
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\include

       niScope.lib
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Lib\msc
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\IVI\Lib_x64\msc
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\Lib\msc
         C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\Lib_x64\msc
